# üïπÔ∏è Game Design Document Generator

**Game Design Document Generator** is a Streamlit application that helps game developers create comprehensive Game Design Documents (GDD) by generating detailed descriptions for the game environment, protagonist, antagonist, and the overall game story. The app leverages Claude AI from Anthropic to produce creative content based on user-provided descriptions.

## Features

- **Customizable Game Environment**: Input your ideas for the game environment, and let the app generate a detailed description.
- **Protagonist & Antagonist Design**: Provide character traits, and the app will create compelling descriptions for both the protagonist and antagonist.
- **Story Creation**: The app synthesizes the environment and character descriptions into an engaging game story.
- **API Key Management**: The app includes built-in API usage limits. After two uses, users can input their own Claude API key to continue generating content.
